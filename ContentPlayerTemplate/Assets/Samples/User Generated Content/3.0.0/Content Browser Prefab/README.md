README - User Generated Content Sample Scenes - Content Browser

## Overview

In this example, you will learn how you could leverage the Creator Economy SDK to display a User Generated Content browser in-app.

This sample uses a prefab called the Content Browser, which is a sample UI hierarchy in-scene which can populate itself with content retrieved from the server. It would allow a
user to view, subscribe to, rate, report and play User Generated Content (UGC).

The SDK currently only allows connection to the services required in Play mode, but this can still be used with Play-In Editor.

## How this sample leverages the SDK

### Connection to Unity Game Services
The Content Browser script (see below) is able to handle the connection to Unity Game Services for the app. It can be configured to target whichever environment is needed. If this
sample is integrated into an existing app, the automatic connection to Unity Game Services here can be disabled in favour of how the aforementioned app handles the connection. 
Please note that a connection to Unity Game Services is required for this sample, as well as any application of User Generated Content, to function in an app.

### Implementation of User Generated Content
Most of the implementation of User Generated Content in handled in the Content Browser itself, or in the Content Dialog View, where the user can interact with the User Generated
Content. The `Content` class of the UGC SDK is of particular import, as that is the synchronizable data model of the Content itself. Other usages include individual content views.

#### Content Browsing
 - The Content Browser contains the set of content filtered first by whether or not viewing all content or subscribed content. Content lists are first obtained via either
 `UgcService.Instance.GetContentsAsync` or `GetSubscriptionsAsync`, depending on the user's chosen Header Tab. For each of the `PagedResults` obtained from the aforementioned
 call, detailed `Content` results are gathered via `UgcService.Instance.GetContentAsync`.

#### Featured Content
 - The Featured Content View first gets the list of featured content via `UgcService.Instance.GetContentsAsync`, passing in a `GetContentsArgs` which is a structure containing
 the various tags by which to filter said content. The results are a set of `PagedResults`, but only one page's worth.
 - The Featured Content View, and in any given Featured Content Button, the content will be set by calling `UgcService.Instance.DownloadContentDataAsync`, which will then get the
 `Content` object and apply the thumbnail to the button image.
 - Additionally, the Featured Content View allows the user to directly view and manipulate the subscription to content, via `UgcService.Instance.IsSubscribedToAsync`,
 `DeleteSubscriptionAsync`, and `CreateSubscriptionAsync`.
 
#### Content Cards
 - Much like the Featured Content section above, the Content Card View will set its `Content` by calling `UgcService.Instance.DownloadContentDataAsync`, which will then get the
 `Content` object and apply the thumbnail to the card image. Additionally, as with the Featured Content, the Content Card allows the user to directly manipulate the subscription to content, via
 `UgcService.Instance.IsSubscribedToAsync`, `DeleteSubscriptionAsync`, and `CreateSubscriptionAsync`.
 
#### Content Dialog View
 - Similar to the Content Cards above, The Content Dialog View will leverage `UgcService.Instance.DownloadContentDataAsync` to download the content and apply the Thumbnail.
 - In addition to gett and manipualiating the subscription status via `UgcService.Instance.IsSubscribedToAsync`, `DeleteSubscriptionAsync`, and `CreateSubscriptionAsync`, the user
 can rate or report the Content. Ratings, wrapped by `ContentUserRating`, are checked and modified via `UgcService.Instance.GetUserContentRatingAsync` and
  `UgcService.Instance.SubmitUserContentRatingAsync` respectively. Likewise content can be reported via `UgcService.Instance.ReportContentAsync`, passing in `ReportContentArgs`.

 
## Content Browser Prefab
 The following is an overview of the Content Browser Prefab itself and what each of the sample's Monobehaviour or UI Component classes do.

### Related Scripts:

#### Content Browser
